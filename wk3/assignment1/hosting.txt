As can be seen from the IPs below and the following pings
and resulting lookups, Canonical hosts their own network 
of servers. All their name servers are hosted by themselves 
in their data centre. They also seem to act as their own ISP 
for themselves, although I did not delve deeper into this.

ns1 and ns2 likely share the same datacenter in Douglas, Scotland;
However, it seems that ns3 (resolves to lime.canonical.com) is 
kept in a different location in London, England.
